## Some explanations about how i thought

### In General

* I considered solid principles and clean code
* Good Commenting, Good Commits and explanatory Commit Messages.
* Prevent unnecessary network traffic at server side.
* Better User Experience

### Onboarding Screen

* Since i need to use more than one pages with the same components, i create the OnboardingPageView to _**avoid code repetition.**_
* OnboardingPageView contains the UI Elements in the blue frames.

1. Created a PageModel (it can also be used if properties fetched from server)
2. Created an enum for each page, give them Int RawValues to represent page number
Add 'getPageData()' method to return the Page's Model. 
3. Since OnboardingPage Enum is CaseIterable, get the count of enum while Appending Pages to pagesArray and append them in a for loop. 
That's how, i avoided hard code and also if there are new pages be added or removed from Onboarding page, developer should only change the Onboarding Page Enum and rest of the code will work properly.

### Auth Screen

* Since i'm going to need a lot of textfields and labels i created a _**custom component named SATextView.**_
* This contains a Label and TextField. Also an animation to change it's color to red and shake the view if _**nothing is written**_ into the textfield.
* _**By checking if the textfield is empty or not on the client side, i prevent to send unnecessary request to server side and lightened the work at the server side.**_
* Then i created SATextWithWithSecureEntry by inherit from SATextView. It allows user to hide and show password by tapping the button.
* These components can be used in the future while asking for user address, credit card informations...

* I created a custom ViewController which conforms to AlertPresentable protocol and two properties that contains screen's width and height.
  * Screen's width and height will be used while giving constraints to achieve _**responsive design.**_
  * AlertPresentable protocol contains functions to create and present alert easily.

### Products Screen

* Created a Protocol for Firestore Read and Write operations
* I'm aware that it's contains tricky methods because the document name and user id is embedded into the function. Not passed as parameters.
  * That's why i'm thinking of making this protocol more generic with enums that contains firestore operation and collection properties.

#### Storing Favorites and Cart items
* I thought about using CoreData to store them but in case of changing to another platform or device user would lost that data.
* I preffered Singleton and Static methods for cart and favorites list and kept them up to date with FireStore.
```bash
final class ProductsManager {
    static let products = ProductsManager()
    static var cart: [Int: Int] = [:]
    static var favorites: [Int] = []
}
```
